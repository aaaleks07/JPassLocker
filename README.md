To generate a strong password, click on the "Generate Password" button and specify the desired length and complexity. The generated password will be automatically copied to your clipboard for easy use.

You can import and export your password data in CSV format for backup or transfer purposes. The import and export options can be accessed through the "File" menu.

JPassLocker automatically locks itself after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access. To unlock the application, simply enter your master password.
